## A common ground for decentralized efficiency

This space, as well as other we'll be building to support Exp-AI operations,
is intended as the official place for developing a common ground in terms of
vision/mission/values, as well as overall strategy.

## How to use

- **First, read:** Content should be organized by verticals, so you can focus only on it. Please,
  take your time to read it all before proceeding with a comment or preparing new content.

- **Second, reach consensus:** As a common ground, aside comments, what lies here is to be accepted
  and respected for everyone as the way to go. Please, try and confirm agreement from a majority
  before proceeding editing content.

- **Be concise:** Everyone accessing this tool has knowledge of the context on, at least everything
  that has to do with his vertical. We're trying to be productive, so please don't expose redundant
  info/ideas and avoid excessive verbosity.
